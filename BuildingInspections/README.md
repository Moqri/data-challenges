#Project Inspector Gadget: Targeted Building Inspections for the City of Chicago

###Project Description

The City of Chicago performs regular inspections of buildings throughout the city. There are lots of buildings to inspect. They would prefer to be able to focus on the ones that are most likely to be involution of building regulations. Our goal is to build a predictive model for the City of Chicago that tells inspectors which buildings they should inspect next week.

####Objectives

Help the City of Chicago understand and improve the building inspection process by

- Identifying patterns in building inspections and violations
- Building a complete data science pipeline that produces an operationally useful list of which buildings the Cityâ€™s building department should inspect
