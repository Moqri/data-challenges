#Project Inspector Gadget: Targeted Building Inspections for the City of Chicago

###Project Description

The City of Chicago's [Department of Buildings](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/bldgs.html/) supports the safety and quality of life for the residents and visitors of the City of Chicago through enforcement of the [Chicago Building Code](https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/bldgs/provdrs/inspect/svcs/chicago_buildingcodeonline.html). The department of buildings issues building permits and performs regular inspections of buildings throughout the city as part of this mandate. The permitting and [inspection](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/bldgs/provdrs/inspect/svcs/request_an_inspection.html) process promotes high quality design standards as well as the conservation, rehabilitation and reuse of the City's existing buildings. There are lots of buildings to inspect. Given its [prior success in building models for predictive inspection with other City departments](https://github.com/Chicago/food-inspections-evaluation) the Department of Innovation and Technology would like to work with the Buildings Department to develop a predictive model that helps building inspectors focus their inspections on the the buildings that are most likely to be involution of building regulations. Our goal is to build a predictive model for the City of Chicago that tells inspectors which buildings they should inspect next week.

####Objectives

Help the City of Chicago understand and improve the building inspection process by

- Identifying patterns in building inspections and violations
- Building a complete data science pipeline that produces an operationally useful list of which buildings the Cityâ€™s building department should inspect
